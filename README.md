# Earthquake-Detection-

This project presents a low-cost earthquake detection and alert 
system using an Arduino Uno microcontroller and an ADXL345 
accelerometer. The system detects sudden ground vibrations and 
triggers an audible alert through a buzzer. A 16x2 LCD displays real
t
 ime status. This prototype is designed for educational purposes 
and can help raise awareness about seismic safety. 
3. Objective 
To design and develop a simple and affordable earthquake detector 
capable of sensing ground vibrations and alerting users instantly. 
4. Components Required: 
• Arduino Uno 
• ADXL345 Accelerometer 
• 16x2 LCD Display (without I2C) 
• Piezoelectric Buzzer 
• Resistors (220Ω) 
• Breadboard and jumper wires 
• 9V battery or USB power
